This is my end-course projects for Google Advanced Data Analytics on Coursera.
In this project, I explore and visualize data, handle outliers and missing values, and engineer features.
The I build a logistic regression model to predict churn. The regression model does not perform well and is uses as a baseline for the next step.
In the last step, I build two machine learning models; XGBoost and Random Forest. These models perform better than logistic regression but despite adding many new features don't perform perfectly.
In the final step, I manipulate threshold to get better result and reduce the number of false positives.
