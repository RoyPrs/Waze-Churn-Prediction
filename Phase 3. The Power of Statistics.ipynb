    "**Phase 3 - The Power of Statistics; Data exploration and hypothesis testing**\n",
    "<br>We are in the midpoint of our user churn project. So far, we’ve used Python to explore and analyze Waze’s user data. We’ve also used Python to create data visualizations. The next step is to use statistical methods to analyze and interpret the data.\n",
    "<br>To be more specific, we need to analyze the relationship between mean amount of rides and device type. i.e. if there is a statistically significant difference in mean amount of rides between iPhone® users and Android™ users. This should be done through a two-sample hypothesis test (t-test) to analyze the difference in the mean amount of rides between iPhone users and Android users.\n",
